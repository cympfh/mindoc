Maybe this is not yet highlighted...

## Paragraph.

Almost plaintexts are interpreted as paragraph.
Paragraphs are separated with one or more empty lines.

Any    whitespaces (including newlines) are
used to	tokenize and   become just one space.
If you wish make a newline explicitly  
you must put two spaces `  `  at the end of line.

> Quote is another paragraph.
> Ofcource, you can use **any markdown** in quoting.
